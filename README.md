# pycarwings2

Library for connecting and interacting with Nissan's CARWINGS service for Nissan LEAF cars.
Uses the (newly secure!) REST/JSON API rather than the previous XML-based API.

Inspired by original pycarwings library: https://github.com/haykinson/pycarwings

## Asynchronous methods

Note that several of the most interesting methods in the CARWINGS service are
asynchronous--you ask the service to do something, and it just says "ok". You then
have to poll a corresponding method to find out if the operation was successful.

More details are located at the top of [pycarwings2.py](https://github.com/jdhorne/pycarwings2/blob/master/pycarwings2/pycarwings2.py).

## Installation

    pip install requests pycrypto configparser
